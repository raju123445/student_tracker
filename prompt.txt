You are an expert full-stack engineer. I am giving you a complete full-stack MERN project with the following folder structure:

Client/
  public/
  src/
    api/api.js
    assets/
    components/
      Card.jsx
      ApplicationsTable.jsx
      CompanySelectionChart.jsx
      CompanyTable.jsx
      FiltersBar.jsx
      StatusDistributionChart.jsx
      StudentTable.jsx
      Table.jsx
      USNSearch.jsx
    hooks/
      useDebounce.js
      useFetch.js
      usePagination.js
    pages/
      DashboardPage.jsx
      Login.jsx
      StudentTrackingPage.jsx
    store/useStore.js
    utils/format.js
    App.jsx
    main.jsx

Server/
  config/db.js
  controller/
      admin.controller.js
      application.controller.js
      company.controller.js
      student.controller.js
  middleware/
  models/
      admin.model.js
      applications.model.js
      company.model.js
      student.model.js
  routes/
      admin.route.js
      application.route.js
      company.route.js
      student.route.js
  server.js

Current Problem:
— Copilot generated only the UI.  
— No API calls are implemented.  
— Dashboard is not reading any real data from MongoDB.  
— Filters (company, status, sem, course, job type, recruitment month) are not connected.  
— Company-wise selections chart shows empty.  
— Status distribution chart is empty.  
— Student tracking page is not fetching data by USN.  
— Backend routes are correct but not used in the frontend.  
— Need complete integration and corrections in both Client & Server.

Your job:
Analyze and fully understand this MERN project structure, including:
  - React components
  - Zustand store
  - Custom hooks (useFetch, pagination, debounce)
  - Backend models, controllers, and routes
  - All API endpoints

Then produce the following improvements:

1. Fix and improve the entire project (frontend + backend) for full functionality.

2. Connect all dashboard UI components to the backend:
   - Total Students
   - Total Companies
   - Total Applications
   - Total Selected
   - Company-wise selection chart
   - Status distribution chart
   - Complete filter bar (company, status, sem, course, job type, recruitment date)
   - Apply + Reset filters.

3. Fix and complete API integration inside:
   src/api/api.js  
   src/hooks/useFetch.js  
   src/store/useStore.js  
   All components that require data.

4. Implement the full USN tracking system:
   - Search by USN
   - Fetch student details by USN
   - Fetch all applications of that student
   - Show status, company, rounds, remarks, final result
   - Timeline UI for rounds (if possible)

5. Clean and improve UI with Tailwind:
   - Better spacing, grid, layout, cards, tables
   - Make charts responsive
   - Improve Filter Bar UI
   - Add loading states, empty states, error states

6. Improve backend if needed:
   - Add endpoints like /students/usn/:usn
   - Add aggregated endpoints for dashboard analytics
   - Optimize controllers for bulk operations
   - Add pagination support

7. Generate:
   - Corrected React components
   - Corrected API functions
   - Updated hooks
   - Updated pages
   - Updated backend controllers & routes
   - Any missing utility files
   - Documentation on how everything connects

8. Ensure the app is scalable for thousands of records.

Important:

Only output code and explanations needed to complete and fix the entire project.

Goal:
When your output is implemented, the entire dashboard must work end-to-end with real backend data, including filtering, charts, USN tracking, tables, pagination, and analytics.

Start now. Understand everything and then generate the full corrected project code.
